## Game Lore

In the world of Warfrost, four mighty races fight for what each of them judge right or wrong; living centuries of war and conflict. Each race possesses unique characteristics, strengths, and a rich history:

- **Humans**: The stalwart defenders of justice and civilization, skilled in both melee combat and powerful spellcasting. They seek harmony and strive to restore balance to the war-torn realm.
- **Elves**: Masters of archery, magic, and ancient wisdom. Elves are guardians of the natural world, harnessing the power of nature itself to defend their lands from all who would desecrate it.
- **Dwarves**: Expert craftsmen and warriors, Dwarves excel in heavy infantry and siege warfare. They are driven by a thirst for exploration and the reclamation of their ancestral underground realms.
- **Orcs**: Ferocious and relentless, Orcs are born warriors, wielding brutal strength and dark magics. They seek domination and conquest, believing that only the strongest survive.

Unleash the power of your chosen race, lead your armies to victory, and shape the destiny of the Warfrost realm.
